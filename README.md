I built a classic Pong game that simulates table tennis. In this game, players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth, aiming to score points by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle. The project was a great way to dive into game development, focusing on simple yet engaging mechanics, and it allowed me to refine my skills in programming and game design.
